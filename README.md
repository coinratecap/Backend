# Backend
This is the backend of coinratecap

The Backend project structure flow goes this way
Model --- Services --- Controllers ---- Routes ---- Route handler ---- root app.js file

Note that any form of route handler should be written in the root app.js file

Create an **uploads** directory in case you want to store the media assets.

##  Coin Listing Methodology
### Price
Using Bitcoin (BTC) as an example, and assuming we only track two exchanges, A and B:

Exchange A: BTC/USD = USD 1,000 / BTC @ 15,000 BTC Trading Volume (rolling 24 hours)

Exchange B: BTC/USD = USD 1,050 / BTC @ 10,000 BTC Trading Volume (rolling 24 hours)

We will then calculate the global volume-weighted average price. In this case, it will be:

BTC Price (USD)

= [Volume % *  First Exchange USD Price] + [Volume % * Second Exchange USD Price]

= [ 15,000 / (15,000 + 10,000) ] * USD 1,000 + [ 10,000 / (15,000 + 10,000) ] * USD 1,050

= 0.6 * USD 1,000 + 0.4 * USD 1,050

= USD 1020

#### Why global volume-weighted average price?
Because the higher the amount of BTC traded in a particular exchange, the higher it mush have an impact on the price of the BTC.  That way if some exchange has a high deviation in value of BTC but low volume traded, it will have a low impact on the price of the crypto in our platform.

### Trading Volume (Cryptoasset)
The trading volume for a crypto asset is the aggregate trading volume of all trading pairs of the crypto asset. Letâ€™s assume Litecoin (LTC) is only traded on Exchange A and has BTC, ETH, and USD trading pairs with the following rolling 24 hours trading volume:

Rolling 24 hours trading volume for LTC in Exchange A:
LTC/BTC = 5,000 LTC
LTC/ETH = 1,000 LTC
LTC/USD = 2,000 LTC

Assuming 1 LTC = USD 100, the 24 hours trading volume for Litecoin will be 5,000 + 1,000 + 2,000 = 8,000 LTC or USD 800,000.

### Market Capitalization (Cryptoasset)
The Market Capitalization of a crypto asset is calculated using the following formula:

Let:
A = Current crypto asset price in USD
B = Available supply of an asset

Market Capitalization = A * B

For example, the market capitalization of 0x is calculated by multiplying the Available Supply of ZRX with its price. Assuming the Available Supply of ZRX is 583,209,787 and the price of ZRX is USD 0.25, the market capitalization is then calculated as 583,209,787 * USD $0.25 = USD 145,802,446.75.

### Market Capitalization (Global)
The Global Market Capitalization is the sum of the Market Capitalization of all projects tracked.
